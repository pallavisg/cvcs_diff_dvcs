manage huge no of servers at the same time.

maximum utilization of system's resources.

cluster resize connects to our provisioning system ans adds new instances.

as and when applications installed and services need to be started,without any human intervention the instances of nodes are utilised ad per requirement ensuring maximum utilization of resources.

we can just specify the no of instances into which we want the load to be distributed and it is done.

spark executes with all other services giving the datacenter a much higher utilisation of resources.

with increase of traffic,auto scalaing is done and utilization of instances already fit in the datacenter.

all 7 services in single dcos cluster and started in just 10 mins.

dcos increases cpu utilization by 45%.


Summary
adding instances whenever sought
distribution of load as specified
45% increase in utilization
traffic increase-auto scaling
7 services started in a single cluster in less than 10 mins
